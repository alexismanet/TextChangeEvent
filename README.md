# TextChangeEvent
jQuery text change event for textarea

Alexis MA

The original version from ZURB http://www.zurb.com/playground/jquery-text-change-custom-event.
(Their online demo is not working any more and it seems they are not continue to maintain this code).

As I use backbone and requirejs a lot, I make a little improvement when setup binding event with dom element.

Demo is written in backbone framework for demonstrate the three custom event (textchange, hastext, notext).
Try it online http://www.alexisma.net/projects/TextChangeEvent/demo/index.html

In inline docs, I add comments for those who want to understand function calls behind the scene.

Happy Coding.
